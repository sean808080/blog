The routine was I would have a few tokes and do the dinner dishes with Ella playing on the radio in the kitchen. It was a relaxing routine and provided a nice respite from the stressors of living in the city. The stressors were pretty harsh living with roommates slowly dying of AIDS in a huge and beautiful and usually empty apartment and being keenly aware of how crowded NYC was and just how close ghettos and suffering families.

What am I now interested in because of this person? \u00b6 Jazz and music from the 50\u2019s Ella Jane Fitzgerald (April 25, 1917 \u2013 June 15, 1996) was an American jazz singer, sometimes referred to as the \u201cFirst Lady of Song\u201d, \u201cQueen of Jazz\u201d, and \u201cLady Ella\u201d. She was noted for her purity of tone, impeccable diction, phrasing, timing, intonation, and a \u201chorn-like\u201d improvisational ability, particularly in her scat singing. After a tumultuous adolescence, Fitzgerald found stability in musical success with the Chick Webb Orchestra, performing across the country but most often associated with the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem. Her rendition of the nursery rhyme \u201cA-Tisket, A-Tasket\u201d helped boost both her and Webb to national fame. After taking over the band when Webb died, Fitzgerald left it behind in 1942 to start her solo career. Her manager was Moe Gale, co-founder of the Savoy, until she turned the rest of her career over to Norman Granz, who founded Verve Records to produce new records by Fitzgerald. With Verve she recorded some of her more widely noted works, particularly her interpretations of the Great American Songbook. While Fitzgerald appeared in movies and as a guest on popular television shows in the second half of the twentieth century, her musical collaborations with Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, and The Ink Spots were some of her most notable acts outside of her solo career. These partnerships produced some of her best-known songs such as \u201cDream a Little Dream of Me\u201d, \u201cCheek to Cheek\u201d, \u201cInto Each Life Some Rain Must Fall\u201d, and \u201cIt Don\u2019t Mean a Thing (If It Ain\u2019t Got That Swing)\u201d. In 1993, after a career of nearly 60 years, she gave her last public performance. Three years later, she died at the age of 79 after years of declining health. Her accolades included 14 Grammy Awards, the National Medal of Arts, the NAACP\u2019s inaugural President\u2019s Award, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

Social media is a new kind of exploitation. While companies or businesses used to capitalize on labor or natural resources to turn a profit, this new industry exploits a totally new resource to make money: personal data from its users.\u2003 Social media platforms invest in massive research projects to refine the algorithms they use to organize and show content. For platforms like YouTube or Instagram, their algorithms can use billions and billions of user data points to get better at showing you content they think you\u2019d like to see based on what you\u2019ve already seen. Oh, and as private corporations, they do all of this for profit, and without much government oversight or regulation. They do all of this for one simple reason: to keep you hooked, long past the time you swore you\u2019d put down your phone and do something meaningful. Each tap or swipe is another nibble of useful data for them. At the same time, every \u201clike\u201d or \u201cshare\u201d on your own TikTok or Insta posts sends a little hit of dopamine to your brain, and the cycle continues. You might even blame yourself and your lack of discipline for all that wasted screen time, too. You\u2019ll vow never to mindlessly scroll again, but spoiler alert: you will.\u2003 The trend only got worse with the rise of portable devices like smartphones and tablets. Now users could offer up their data 24-7, wherever they went. So from attending a work meeting, paying bills, swiping on Tinder or calling your Mom, your participation in much of life now happens\u2003 through a single device.\u2003 Since everything is online these days \u2013 from job portals to dating sites \u2013 you\u2019re encouraged to think of yourself along these same lines. No more applying for a position or wooing a love interest. Market yourself to employers or partners so they\u2019ll smash that like button. Don\u2019t have a personality, have a profile\u2014without quirks, surprises, contradictions, or mysteries.\u2003 And so, given that life is more complicated than a hashtag, you have to diminish yourself to fit the algorithm. When this becomes easy, you might forget that there are other humans out there who interpret the me you put out online. While a heated Facebook debate might seem harmless, online arguments now spill over into the rest of life\u2014dividing families, polarizing politics, and costing real lives.\u2003 As you watch the world through your device, your device can watch you, too. The internet also functions as a new form of global surveillance, with smart devices listening in to homes, cars, workplaces and schools. They can track where you go and who else is there, even how many steps you took along the way. So, next we\u2019ll take on some of the biggest myths surrounding the internet, and a few of its dark realities. We\u2019ll look for the roots of the online revolution in history, biology, philosophy and mathematics\u2013 in order to uncover how we got into this mess, and what we have to do to get out.","title":"Social Media Disclaimer"},{"location":"Tennessee%20Williams/","text":"Tennessee Williams \u00b6 \u201cYou\u2019ll become a better writer and person when you realize how brief and brutal and glorious life is.
