What am I now interested in because of this person? \u00b6 Jazz and music from the 50\u2019s Ella Jane Fitzgerald (April 25, 1917 \u2013 June 15, 1996) was an American jazz singer, sometimes referred to as the \u201cFirst Lady of Song\u201d, \u201cQueen of Jazz\u201d, and \u201cLady Ella\u201d. She was noted for her purity of tone, impeccable diction, phrasing, timing, intonation, and a \u201chorn-like\u201d improvisational ability, particularly in her scat singing. After a tumultuous adolescence, Fitzgerald found stability in musical success with the Chick Webb Orchestra, performing across the country but most often associated with the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem. Her rendition of the nursery rhyme \u201cA-Tisket, A-Tasket\u201d helped boost both her and Webb to national fame. After taking over the band when Webb died, Fitzgerald left it behind in 1942 to start her solo career. Her manager was Moe Gale, co-founder of the Savoy, until she turned the rest of her career over to Norman Granz, who founded Verve Records to produce new records by Fitzgerald. With Verve she recorded some of her more widely noted works, particularly her interpretations of the Great American Songbook. While Fitzgerald appeared in movies and as a guest on popular television shows in the second half of the twentieth century, her musical collaborations with Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, and The Ink Spots were some of her most notable acts outside of her solo career. These partnerships produced some of her best-known songs such as \u201cDream a Little Dream of Me\u201d, \u201cCheek to Cheek\u201d, \u201cInto Each Life Some Rain Must Fall\u201d, and \u201cIt Don\u2019t Mean a Thing (If It Ain\u2019t Got That Swing)\u201d. In 1993, after a career of nearly 60 years, she gave her last public performance. Three years later, she died at the age of 79 after years of declining health. Her accolades included 14 Grammy Awards, the National Medal of Arts, the NAACP\u2019s inaugural President\u2019s Award, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

While companies or businesses used to capitalize on labor or natural resources to turn a profit, this new industry exploits a totally new resource to make money: personal data from its users.\u2003 Social media platforms invest in massive research projects to refine the algorithms they use to organize and show content. For platforms like YouTube or Instagram, their algorithms can use billions and billions of user data points to get better at showing you content they think you\u2019d like to see based on what you\u2019ve already seen. Oh, and as private corporations, they do all of this for profit, and without much government oversight or regulation. They do all of this for one simple reason: to keep you hooked, long past the time you swore you\u2019d put down your phone and do something meaningful. Each tap or swipe is another nibble of useful data for them. At the same time, every \u201clike\u201d or \u201cshare\u201d on your own TikTok or Insta posts sends a little hit of dopamine to your brain, and the cycle continues. You might even blame yourself and your lack of discipline for all that wasted screen time, too. You\u2019ll vow never to mindlessly scroll again, but spoiler alert: you will.\u2003 The trend only got worse with the rise of portable devices like smartphones and tablets. Now users could offer up their data 24-7, wherever they went. So from attending a work meeting, paying bills, swiping on Tinder or calling your Mom, your participation in much of life now happens\u2003 through a single device.\u2003 Since everything is online these days \u2013 from job portals to dating sites \u2013 you\u2019re encouraged to think of yourself along these same lines. No more applying for a position or wooing a love interest. Market yourself to employers or partners so they\u2019ll smash that like button. Don\u2019t have a personality, have a profile\u2014without quirks, surprises, contradictions, or mysteries.\u2003 And so, given that life is more complicated than a hashtag, you have to diminish yourself to fit the algorithm. When this becomes easy, you might forget that there are other humans out there who interpret the me you put out online. While a heated Facebook debate might seem harmless, online arguments now spill over into the rest of life\u2014dividing families, polarizing politics, and costing real lives.\u2003 As you watch the world through your device, your device can watch you, too. The internet also functions as a new form of global surveillance, with smart devices listening in to homes, cars, workplaces and schools. They can track where you go and who else is there, even how many steps you took along the way. So, next we\u2019ll take on some of the biggest myths surrounding the internet, and a few of its dark realities. We\u2019ll look for the roots of the online revolution in history, biology, philosophy and mathematics\u2013 in order to uncover how we got into this mess, and what we have to do to get out.","title":"Social Media Disclaimer"},{"location":"Tennessee%20Williams/","text":"Tennessee Williams \u00b6 \u201cYou\u2019ll become a better writer and person when you realize how brief and brutal and glorious life is.

And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people. ( Location\u200341 ) Tags: orange A genius who loses control of their emotions can be a financial disaster. The opposite is also true. Ordinary folks with no financial education can be wealthy if they have a handful of behavioral skills that have nothing to do with formal measures of intelligence.

( Location\u200380 ) Tags: orange I love Voltaire\u2019s observation that \u201cHistory never repeats itself; man always does.\u201d It applies so well to how we behave with money. ( Location\u2003115 ) Tags: pink As investor Michael Batnick says, \u201csome lessons have to be experienced before they can be understood.\u201d We are all victims, in different ways, to that truth. ( Location\u2003156 ) If you were born in 1970, the S&P 500 increased almost 10-fold, adjusted for inflation, during your teens and 20s. That\u2019s an amazing return. If you were born in 1950, the market went literally nowhere in your teens and 20s adjusted for inflation. Two groups of people, separated by chance of their birth year, go through life with a completely different view on how the stock market works: ( Location\u2003174 ) Before World War II most Americans worked until they died. That was the expectation and the reality. The labor force participation rate of men age 65 and over was above 50% until the 1940s: ( Location\u2003233 ) More than a quarter of Americans over age 65 were classified by the Census Bureau as living in poverty until the late 1960s. ( Location\u2003237 ) \u201cOnly a quarter of those age 65 or older had pension income in 1975.\u201d Among that lucky minority, only 15% of household income came from a pension. ( Location\u2003240 ) It was not until the 1980s that the idea that everyone deserves, and should have, a dignified retirement took hold. ( Location\u2003243 ) The 401(k)\u2014the backbone savings vehicle of American retirement\u2014did not exist until 1978. The Roth IRA was not born until 1998. If it were a person it would be barely old enough to drink. ( Location\u2003245 ) The share of Americans over age 25 with a bachelor\u2019s degree has gone from less than 1 in 20 in 1940 to 1 in 4 by 2015.7 The average college tuition over that time rose more than fourfold adjusted for inflation. ( Location\u2003248 ) Luck and risk are siblings. They are both the reality that every outcome in life is guided by forces other than individual effort. NYU professor Scott Galloway has a related idea that is so important to remember when judging success\u2014both your own and others\u2019: \u201cNothing is as good or as bad as it seems.\u201d ( Location\u2003262 ) The cover of Forbes magazine does not celebrate poor investors who made good decisions but happened to experience the unfortunate side of risk. But it almost certainly celebrates rich investors who made OK or even reckless decisions and happened to get lucky. Both flipped the same coin that happened to land on a different side. ( Location\u2003337 ) The line between \u201cinspiringly bold\u201d and \u201cfoolishly reckless\u201d can be a millimeter thick and only visible with hindsight. Risk and luck are doppelgangers. This is not an easy problem to solve. The difficulty in identifying what is luck, what is skill, and what is risk is one of the biggest problems we face when trying to learn about the best way to manage money. But two things can point you in a better direction. Be careful who you praise and admire. Be careful who you look down upon and wish to avoid becoming. ( Location\u2003375 ) Therefore, focus less on specific individuals and case studies and more on broad patterns. ( Location\u2003385 ) Bill Gates once said, \u201cSuccess is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can\u2019t lose.\u201d ( Location\u2003397 ) The question we should ask of both Gupta and Madoff is why someone worth hundreds of millions of dollars would be so desperate for more money that they risked everything in pursuit of even more. Crime committed by those living on the edge of survival is one thing. A Nigerian scam artist once told The New York Times that he felt guilty for hurting others, but \u201cpoverty will not make you feel the pain.\u201d13 What Gupta and Madoff did is something different. They already had everything: unimaginable wealth, prestige, power, freedom. And they threw it all away because they wanted more. They had no sense of enough. ( Location\u2003450 ) There is no reason to risk what you have and need for what you don\u2019t have and don\u2019t need. ( Location\u2003462 ) Modern capitalism is a pro at two things: generating wealth and generating envy. Perhaps they go hand in hand; wanting to surpass your peers can be the fuel of hard work. But life isn\u2019t any fun without a sense of enough. Happiness, as it\u2019s said, is just results minus expectations. ( Location\u2003471 ) Reputation is invaluable. Freedom and independence are invaluable. Family and friends are invaluable. Being loved by those who you want to love you is invaluable. Happiness is invaluable. And your best shot at keeping these things is knowing when it\u2019s time to stop taking risks that might harm them. Knowing when you have enough. ( Location\u2003501 ) Many bets fail not because they were wrong, but because they were mostly right in a situation that required things to be exactly right. Room for error\u2014often called margin of safety\u2014is one of the most underappreciated forces in finance. It comes in many forms: A frugal budget, flexible thinking, and a loose timeline\u2014anything that lets you live happily with a range of outcomes. ( Location\u2003697 ) Effectively all of the index\u2019s overall returns came from 7% of component companies that outperformed by at least two standard deviations.

Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert once said: At every stage of our lives we make decisions that will profoundly influence the lives of the people we\u2019re going to become, and then when we become those people, we\u2019re not always thrilled with the decisions we made. So young people pay good money to get tattoos removed that teenagers paid good money to get. Middle-aged people rushed to divorce people who young adults rushed to marry. Older adults work hard to lose what middle-aged adults worked hard to gain. On and on and on.48 ( Location\u20031555 ) We should avoid the extreme ends of financial planning.

( Location\u20031576 ) We should also come to accept the reality of changing our minds. Some of the most miserable workers I\u2019ve met are people who stay loyal to a career only because it\u2019s the field they picked when deciding on a college major at age 18.

They make our future selves prisoners to our past, different, selves. It\u2019s the equivalent of a stranger making major life decisions for you. ( Location\u20031596 ) Most things are harder in practice than they are in theory. Sometimes this is because we\u2019re overconfident. More often it\u2019s because we\u2019re not good at identifying what the price of success is, which prevents us from being able to pay it. ( Location\u20031619 ) The result was that under Welch\u2019s leadership, stockholders didn\u2019t have to pay the price. They got consistency and predictability\u2014a stock that surged year after year without the surprises of uncertainty. Then the bill came due, like it always does. GE shareholders have suffered through a decade of mammoth losses that were previously shielded by accounting maneuvers. The penny gains of Welch\u2019s era became dime losses today. ( Location\u20031667 ) Market returns are never free and never will be. They demand you pay a price, like any other product. You\u2019re not forced to pay this fee, just like you\u2019re not forced to go to Disneyland. You can go to the local county fair where tickets might be $10, or stay home for free. You might still have a good time. But you\u2019ll usually get what you pay for. Same with markets. The volatility/uncertainty fee\u2014the price of returns\u2014is the cost of admission to get returns greater than low-fee parks like cash and bonds.

Saving money is the gap between your ego and your income, and wealth is what you don\u2019t see.

A gap between what could happen in the future and what you need to happen in the future in order to do well is what gives you endurance, and endurance is what makes compounding magic over time.

Everyone\u2019s goals and desires will change over time, and the more extreme your past decisions were the more you may regret them as you evolve.

If you were born in 1950, the market went literally nowhere in your teens and 20s adjusted for inflation. Two groups of people, separated by chance of their birth year, go through life with a completely different view on how the stock market works: ( Location\u2003174 ) Before World War II most Americans worked until they died.

( Location\u2003248 ) Luck and risk are siblings. They are both the reality that every outcome in life is guided by forces other than individual effort. NYU professor Scott Galloway has a related idea that is so important to remember when judging success\u2014both your own and others\u2019: \u201cNothing is as good or as bad as it seems.\u201d ( Location\u2003262 ) The cover of Forbes magazine does not celebrate poor investors who made good decisions but happened to experience the unfortunate side of risk. But it almost certainly celebrates rich investors who made OK or even reckless decisions and happened to get lucky. Both flipped the same coin that happened to land on a different side. ( Location\u2003337 ) The line between \u201cinspiringly bold\u201d and \u201cfoolishly reckless\u201d can be a millimeter thick and only visible with hindsight. Risk and luck are doppelgangers. This is not an easy problem to solve. The difficulty in identifying what is luck, what is skill, and what is risk is one of the biggest problems we face when trying to learn about the best way to manage money. But two things can point you in a better direction. Be careful who you praise and admire. Be careful who you look down upon and wish to avoid becoming.

A Nigerian scam artist once told The New York Times that he felt guilty for hurting others, but \u201cpoverty will not make you feel the pain.\u201d13 What Gupta and Madoff did is something different.

But life isn\u2019t any fun without a sense of enough. Happiness, as it\u2019s said, is just results minus expectations. ( Location\u2003471 ) Reputation is invaluable. Freedom and independence are invaluable. Family and friends are invaluable. Being loved by those who you want to love you is invaluable. Happiness is invaluable.

( Location\u20031331 ) The average time between recessions has grown from about two years in the late 1800s to five years in the early 20th century to eight years over the last half-century. As I write this it looks like we\u2019re going into recession\u201412 years since the last recession began in December 2007. That\u2019s the longest gap between recessions since before the Civil War. ( Location\u20031342 ) The End of History Illusion is what psychologists call the tendency for people to be keenly aware of how much they\u2019ve changed in the past, but to underestimate how much their personalities, desires, and goals are likely to change in the future. Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert once said: At every stage of our lives we make decisions that will profoundly influence the lives of the people we\u2019re going to become, and then when we become those people, we\u2019re not always thrilled with the decisions we made. So young people pay good money to get tattoos removed that teenagers paid good money to get. Middle-aged people rushed to divorce people who young adults rushed to marry. Older adults work hard to lose what middle-aged adults worked hard to gain. On and on and on.48 ( Location\u20031555 ) We should avoid the extreme ends of financial planning. Assuming you\u2019ll be happy with a very low income, or choosing to work endless hours in pursuit of a high one, increases the odds that you\u2019ll one day find yourself at a point of regret. ( Location\u20031576 ) We should also come to accept the reality of changing our minds. Some of the most miserable workers I\u2019ve met are people who stay loyal to a career only because it\u2019s the field they picked when deciding on a college major at age 18. ( Location\u20031586 ) \u201cWhen I asked Danny how he could start again as if we had never written an earlier draft,\u201d Zweig continued, \u201che said the words I\u2019ve never forgotten: \u2018I have no sunk costs.\u2019\u201d49 Sunk costs\u2014anchoring decisions to past efforts that can\u2019t be refunded\u2014are a devil in a world where people change over time. They make our future selves prisoners to our past, different, selves. It\u2019s the equivalent of a stranger making major life decisions for you. ( Location\u20031596 ) Most things are harder in practice than they are in theory. Sometimes this is because we\u2019re overconfident. More often it\u2019s because we\u2019re not good at identifying what the price of success is, which prevents us from being able to pay it. ( Location\u20031619 ) The result was that under Welch\u2019s leadership, stockholders didn\u2019t have to pay the price. They got consistency and predictability\u2014a stock that surged year after year without the surprises of uncertainty. Then the bill came due, like it always does. GE shareholders have suffered through a decade of mammoth losses that were previously shielded by accounting maneuvers. The penny gains of Welch\u2019s era became dime losses today. ( Location\u20031667 ) Market returns are never free and never will be. They demand you pay a price, like any other product. You\u2019re not forced to pay this fee, just like you\u2019re not forced to go to Disneyland. You can go to the local county fair where tickets might be $10, or stay home for free. You might still have a good time. But you\u2019ll usually get what you pay for. Same with markets. The volatility/uncertainty fee\u2014the price of returns\u2014is the cost of admission to get returns greater than low-fee parks like cash and bonds. ( Location\u20031686 ) Go out of your way to find humility when things are going right and forgiveness/compassion when they go wrong. Because it\u2019s never as good or as bad as it looks. The world is big and complex. Luck and risk are both real and hard to identify. ( Location\u20032150 ) Less ego, more wealth. Saving money is the gap between your ego and your income, and wealth is what you don\u2019t see. So wealth is created by suppressing what you could buy today in order to have more stuff or more options in the future. ( Location\u20032153 ) Manage your money in a way that helps you sleep at night. That\u2019s different from saying you should aim to earn the highest returns or save a specific percentage of your income. ( Location\u20032156 ) If you want to do better as an investor, the single most powerful thing you can do is increase your time horizon. Time is the most powerful force in investing. ( Location\u20032160 ) Become OK with a lot of things going wrong. You can be wrong half the time and still make a fortune, because a small minority of things account for the majority of outcomes. ( Location\u20032162 ) Use money to gain control over your time, because not having control of your time is such a powerful and universal drag on happiness. ( Location\u20032167 ) Be nicer and less flashy. No one is impressed with your possessions as much as you are. ( Location\u20032170 ) Save. Just save. You don\u2019t need a specific reason to save. It\u2019s great to save for a car, or a downpayment, or a medical emergency. But saving for things that are impossible to predict or define is one of the best reasons to save. ( Location\u20032172 ) Define the cost of success and be ready to pay it. Because nothing worthwhile is free. And remember that most financial costs don\u2019t have visible price tags. ( Location\u20032175 ) Worship room for error. A gap between what could happen in the future and what you need to happen in the future in order to do well is what gives you endurance, and endurance is what makes compounding magic over time. ( Location\u20032178 ) Avoid the extreme ends of financial decisions. Everyone\u2019s goals and desires will change over time, and the more extreme your past decisions were the more you may regret them as you evolve. ( Location\u20032181 ) You should like risk because it pays off over time. But you should be paranoid of ruinous risk because it prevents you from taking future risks that will pay off over time. ( Location\u20032183 ) Define the game you\u2019re playing, and make sure your actions are not being influenced by people playing a different game. ( Location\u20032184 ) Respect the mess. Smart, informed, and reasonable people can disagree in finance, because people have vastly different goals and desires. There is no single right answer; just the answer that works for you. ( Location\u20032185 ) Doctors] don\u2019t die like the rest of us,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhat\u2019s unusual about them is not how much treatment they get compared to most Americans, but how little. For all the time they spend fending off the deaths of others, they tend to be fairly serene when faced with death themselves. They know exactly what is going to happen, they know the choices, and they generally have access to any sort of medical care they could want. But they go gently.\u201d A doctor may throw the kitchen sink at her patient\u2019s cancer, but choose palliative care for herself. ( Location\u20032199 ) Charlie Munger once said \u201cI did not intend to get rich. I just wanted to get independent.\u201d We can leave aside rich, but independence has always been my personal financial goal. ( Location\u20032211 ) Independence, to me, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll stop working. It means you only do the work you like with people you like at the times you want for as long as you want. ( Location\u20032222 ) My investing strategy doesn\u2019t rely on picking the right sector, or timing the next recession. It relies on a high savings rate, patience, and optimism that the global economy will create value over the next several decades. I spend virtually all of my investing effort thinking about those three things\u2014especially the first two, which I can control.
