# my rusty old resurrected and reinvigorated blog
---
### Introduction
I've decided to restart a website and instead of dealing with adminstration, I'll use a few hooks to publish content to the site with a simple tag.

---
### The content
The header of this site has navigation that is based on a sampling of what I make public in my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault simply by adding a [YAML](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/automation/what-is-yaml) tag
```yaml
share: TRUE
```
---
Just by adding that YAML tag to whatever note I'm working on will automatically publish the page to Github and the Jekyll site will automatically get updated.  Nice...
