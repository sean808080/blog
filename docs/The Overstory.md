## Highlights
- He’ll build a career on that theme: cuing, priming, framing, confirmation bias, and the conflation of correlation with causality—all these faults, built into the brain of the most problematic of large mammals. ([Location 755](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073VX7HT4&location=755))
- A tree that poisons the ground beneath itself so nothing else can grow. ([Location 761](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073VX7HT4&location=761))
- Plans in the absence of any planner. Paths in the absence of a surveyor. ([Location 830](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073VX7HT4&location=830))
- Entire weekends in basements pitching dice and arguing over esoteric role-playing rules with obese, anemic boy-men who tote suitcases full of collectible trading cards. ([Location 886](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073VX7HT4&location=886))
- The beaches and bays are not forbidden him. ([Location 1697](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073VX7HT4&location=1697))
- The fraction of an ounce of beechnut now weighs more than she does. But the soil weighs just what it did, minus an ounce or two. There’s no other explanation: almost all the tree’s mass has come from the very air. Her father knew this. Now she does, too. ([Location 1849](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073VX7HT4&location=1849))
- Where the deer bound, where the trout rise, where your horse stops to slather a drink from icy water while the sun is warm on the back of your neck, where every breath you draw is exhilaration — that is where the Aspens grow. ([Location 1872](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073VX7HT4&location=1872))
- We all travel the Milky Way together, trees and men. . . . In every walk with nature one receives far more than he seeks. The clearest way into the universe is through a forest wilderness. ([Location 1940](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073VX7HT4&location=1940))
    - Note: Muir speaks...
- The past always comes clearer, in the future. ([Location 2068](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073VX7HT4&location=2068))

- Life will not answer to reason. ([Location 2076](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073VX7HT4&location=2076))
- There are no individuals. There aren’t even separate species. Everything in the forest is the forest. ([Location 2230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073VX7HT4&location=2230))

- There are a hundred thousand species of love, separately invented, each more ingenious than the last, and every one of them keeps making things. ([Location 2266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073VX7HT4&location=2266))
- Here’s the thing about an apple: it sticks in the throat. It’s a package deal: lust and understanding. Immortality and death. Sweet pulp with cyanide seeds. It’s a bang on the head that births up whole sciences. A golden delicious discord, the kind of gift chucked into a wedding feast that leads to endless war. It’s the fruit that keeps the gods alive. The first, worst crime, but a fortunate windfall. Blessed be the time that apple taken was. ([Location 2479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073VX7HT4&location=2479))
    - Note: Have a bite.
- No strangeness stranger than the strangeness of living things. ([Location 2748](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B073VX7HT4&location=2748))
