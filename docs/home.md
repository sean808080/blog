# my rusty old resurrected and reinvigorated blog
---
### Introduction
I've decided to restart a website and instead of dealing with adminstration, I'll use a few hooks to publish content to the site with a simple tag.

---
### The content
The header of this site has navigation that is based on a sampling of what I make public in my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault simply by adding a [YAML](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/automation/what-is-yaml) tag
```yaml
share: TRUE
```
---
Just by adding that YAML tag to whatever note I'm working on will automatically publish the page to Github and the Jekyll site will automatically get updated.  Nice...

〽️ Obsidian Vault Stats
	-  File Count: `$=dv.pages().length`
	- Encounters Backlog: `$=dv.pages('"+ Encounters"').length`
	-  Cards Count: `$=dv.pages('"Cards"').length`
