I've been on twitter for longer than I care to remember. I remember signing up for it back in my MTV days.  It seemed to have such promise and I can share stories (another day) where it really blew my mind in what it was able to do for it's users.

That being said, here's a sampling of my latest tweets.  Follow if you aren't already.
